# EX 4A DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING - 1
## DATE:
## AIM:
To find longest common subsequence using Dynamic Programming.



## Algorithm
1. Create a table c where each cell stores the LCS length for parts of u and v.
2. Fill the table from the end of both strings towards the start.
3. If characters match, add 1 to the LCS length; else take the maximum of two possible moves.
4. Start from the beginning and move through c to reconstruct one LCS.
5. Print the matching characters along the path.

    for j in range(len(v)):

                c[i][j] = 1 + c[i + 1][j + 1]
            else:
                c[i][j] = max(c[i + 1][j], c[i][j + 1])

    while not (i == len(u) or j == len(v)):

            print(u[i], end='')
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif c[i][j + 1] > c[i + 1][j]:
            j += 1

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for computing the length of longest common subsequence.
