# EX 4C DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING â€“ 3
## DATE:
## AIM:
Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.

## Algorithm
1. Take the input string and reverse it.
2. Compare both strings using dynamic programming to find matching characters.
3. If characters match, increase the length by 1 and move diagonally.
4. If not matching, move in the direction where maximum length is found (left or up).
5. Final answer is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

    if (n1 == 0 or n2 == 0):       
        return 0    
    if (dp[n1][n2] != -1):      
        return dp[n1][n2]    
    if (s1[n1 - 1] == s2[n2 - 1]):       
        dp[n1][n2] = 1 + lps(s1, s2, n1 - 1, n2 - 1)       
        return dp[n1][n2]    
    else:      
        dp[n1][n2] = max(lps(s1, s2, n1 - 1, n2), lps(s1, s2, n1, n2 - 1))      
        return dp[n1][n2]
seq = input()
n = len(seq)
s2 = seq
s2 = s2[::-1]
print(f"The length of the LPS is",lps(s2, seq, n, n))

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding the length of longest palindromic string.
